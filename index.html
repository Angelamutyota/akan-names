     <p class="description">Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. The <strong> akan names calculator </strong> takes the user's birthday date and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. </p>
